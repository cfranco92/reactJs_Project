# reactJs_Project
React JS project with Platzi.

# What is React.js?
**React** fulfills its function as a library since to use its code it must be imported. It's also a Framework although the conventions of how everything should be organized are not strict.

**React is declarative**, which means that it tells you what to do but not how to do it, thus saving many steps.

**JSX** is HTML within Javascript, this will be seen in detail later.

React is structured by **components** that are like small lego blocks that when joined together form React applications. These components can have styles, be linked to events and their states can be modified.

With React you also have the advantage that it will be written only once and can be used in web and mobile applications, among others.

# Tools
These are the tools:

* **Browser:** Especially Chrome since it has excellent development tools.
* **React Developer Tools:** It is an Open Source tool created by Facebook and has installation for Chrome or Firefox. It will let us see the React code by inspecting elements.
* **Text editor:** You can use any, in this course we suggest Visual Studio Code. It has many useful plugins for development.
* **Prettier:** It is a plugin that makes the code look good no matter how it is written.
